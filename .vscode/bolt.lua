--- @class Bolt
--- @field apiversion fun(): integer, integer Returns the Bolt API major version and minor version, in that order. Plugins should call this function on startup and, if the major version is one it doesn’t recognise, it should exit by calling ‘error()‘. The minor version however does not need to be checked, as minor versions will never contain breaking changes; they may add features, though, and the minor version can be used to check for the existence of those features.
--- @field checkversion fun(expected_major: integer, expected_minor: integer): nil A simple alternative to apiversion which calls error() if either of these conditions is true: 1. the first parameter is not equal to Bolt’s major version. 2. the second parameter is greater than Bolt’s minor version. This function will never return on failure, since that’s the implementation of Lua’s error() function. Calling error() in a Bolt plugin will always be handled by stopping the plugin.]]
